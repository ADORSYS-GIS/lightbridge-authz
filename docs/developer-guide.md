# Developer Guide

Welcome, fellow developer! We're so excited to have you on board. This guide will help you get set up with our development process, ensuring that your contributions are smooth and delightful.

## Pre-commit Hooks: Your Friendly Neighborhood Code Guardian

To help us maintain code quality and consistency, we use pre-commit hooks. These are automated checks that run on your code before you even commit it! Think of it as a friendly little robot that helps you spot issues early.

### Installation

Getting started is a breeze! Just follow these simple steps:

1.  **Install pre-commit:** If you don't have it already, you can install it using pip.

    ```bash
    pip install pre-commit
    ```

2.  **Set up the git hooks:** Navigate to the root of the repository and run:

    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```

And that's it! Now, every time you run `git commit`, the pre-commit hooks will automatically check your changes. If they find any issues, they'll let you know so you can fix them before the code is committed. Easy peasy!

## CI/CD Pipeline: Our Automated Quality Assurance Team

We have a nifty CI/CD pipeline set up with GitHub Actions. This pipeline automatically runs a series of checks on every pull request to ensure that our codebase stays in tip-top shape.

The pipeline runs checks like:
-   **Linting:** To ensure the code style is consistent.
-   **Testing:** To make sure all our features are working as expected.
-   **Building:** To confirm that the project builds successfully.

This means you can have confidence that your changes are solid before they get merged. For a more detailed look at our CI/CD setup, be sure to check out our [CI/CD Architecture documentation](ci-cd-architecture.md).

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
